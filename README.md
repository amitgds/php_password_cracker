# Password Cracker Tool

This is a password cracking tool designed to attempt cracking hashed passwords from a database using various password combinations. The project uses PHP for the backend and jQuery/HTML for the frontend.

## Features

- **Password Cracking:** It attempts to crack passwords stored in a database using various precomputed combinations and checks against dictionary words.
- **Categories of Cracked Passwords:** It classifies cracked passwords into three categories: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- **Caching:** Once a password is cracked, it is stored in a cache to avoid redundant operations.
- **Frontend Interface:** Provides an interface for viewing the cracked passwords.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** PHP 8.0.30
- **Frontend:** HTML, jQuery
- **Database:** MySQL (Database name: `cracker`)
- **Server:** Apache/2.4.59 (Win64)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Apache** with PHP support
- **MySQL** database
- **PHP** (version 8.0.30 or above)
- **jQuery** (used in frontend)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database named `cracker` using the following command:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE cracker;


Create the necessary table not_so_smart_users to store the user data. Hereâ€™s a sample schema:

CREATE TABLE not_so_smart_users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

Import the hashed passwords into the not_so_smart_users table.

2. Backend Setup
Ensure the cracker.php file is placed in your Apache's htdocs directory (or the equivalent directory for your local server).

Modify the config/db.php file to reflect your database credentials:

php code
$host = 'localhost'; 
$dbname = 'cracker';
$username = 'root';
$password = ''; // Adjust if necessary

try {
    $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname", $username, $password);
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo 'Connection failed: ' . $e->getMessage();
}

Make sure the cracker.php file has the correct file permissions to execute.

3. Frontend Setup
The frontend HTML file, index.html, should be placed in the same directory as cracker.php or in the public directory where you host your files.

Open index.html in a browser to interact with the tool.

4. Running the Application
Start the Apache server with PHP support.

Access index.html via the browser (e.g., http://localhost/index.html).

5. Testing the Functionality
Once the setup is complete, the application will crack passwords based on precomputed combinations and dictionary checks. It will classify the cracked passwords into categories such as:

Easy: Numeric or simple combinations.

Medium: Mixed-case words (such as "AbC12z").

Hard: Complex passwords with upper, lower, and numeric characters.

The cracked passwords will be stored in the cache and categorized as shown in the frontend interface.

Example Response

"{
    "Easy": [
        {"id": 1, "password": "12345"},
        {"id": 2, "password": "23456"}
    ],
    "Medium": [
        {"id": 3, "password": "AbC12z"},
        {"id": 4, "password": "abcde"}
    ],
    "Hard": [
        {"id": 5, "password": "aBcD123"},
        {"id": 6, "password": "L0ndon!5"}
    ]
}"
